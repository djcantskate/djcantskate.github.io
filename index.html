        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I'm a senior at Towson University studying computer science. I technically switched from
            that to a specific focus on Software Engineering and though I'm not 100% sure what I want
            to do with it when I get out of here (hopefully by Winter 2024 fingers crossed), I just know
            I want it to involve writing code to solve a problem. I initially wanted to pursue game design
            which was sparked by my childhood curiosities playing Pokemon. I asked myself:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How does the game know what's "super" and "not very" effective?</li>
            <li>How does it know how much health to take depending on what move is used?</li>
            <li>What's making it so I can find some Pokemon more often than others while some are rarer?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It hit me that these were all things programmed by people and that this was only a fraction of what could be 
            done through programming. Though my mind isn't as focused on game design these days (not that I'm closed to it),
            I just want to be able to program and fully enjoy what I do going forward. So far I've gained experience
            in a multitude of languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, and Java and am looking forward to learning
            what more I can do to build upon these.
        </p>
